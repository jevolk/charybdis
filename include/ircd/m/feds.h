/// requests and conducts them to all servers in a room (e.g. m::room::origins)
/// at the same time.
///
/// This is a "hybrid" of internally asynchronous operations anchored to a
/// context by a synchronous execution device (`feds::execute`). The closure
/// is invoked asynchronously as results come in. If the closure returns false,
/// the interface function will return immediately and all pending requests will
/// go out of scope and may be cancelled as per ircd::server decides.
///
/// Alternatively, m::fetch is another federation network interface much better
/// suited to find-and-retrieve for a single piece of data (i.e an event). This
/// interface unconditionally launches requests to every server in parallel, if
/// one server's response provides a satisfying result this method can be
/// wasteful in comparison.
